1)  Download and setup Redis

        wget http://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz
        tar xvzf redis-stable.tar.gz
        cd redis-stable
        make

2)  Create a directory where to store your Redis config files and your data:
        sudo mkdir /etc/redis
        sudo mkdir /var/redis

3)  Copy the init script that you'll find in the Redis distribution under the utils directory into /etc/init.d.
        sudo cp utils/redis_init_script /etc/init.d/redis_6379

4)  Edit the init script.
        sudo vim /etc/init.d/redis_6379

        make sure the
        redis-server &
        redis-cli
        path are all set correctly.

        Use the correct port number as well

5)  Copy the template configuration file you'll find in the root directory of the Redis distribution into /etc/redis/
    using the port number as name, for instance:
        sudo cp redis.conf /etc/redis/6379.conf

6)  Create a directory inside /var/redis that will work as data and working directory for this Redis instance:
        sudo mkdir /var/redis/6379

7)  Edit the configuration file, making sure to perform the following changes:
        Set daemonize to yes (by default it is set to no).
        Set the pidfile to /var/run/redis_6379.pid (modify the port if needed).
        Change the port accordingly. In our example it is not needed as the default port is already 6379.
        Set your preferred loglevel.
        Set the logfile to /var/log/redis_6379.log
        Set the dir to /var/redis/6379 (very important step!)

8)  Add the new Redis init script to all the default runlevels using the following command:
        sudo update-rc.d redis_6379 defaults

9)  You are done! Now you can try running your instance with:
        /etc/init.d/redis_6379 start
        /etc/init.d/redis_6379 stop

10) Enable AOF
        In the conf file search for AOF settings and set it to Yes
